## TechHub

It is an application that contains previous, current and new technical projects. Previous projects are uploaded by team members to share the experience with others and see comments and ratings. Financiers/buyers can purchase or support these projects. New projects are uploaded as ideas by the owner who requests developers, financiers, etc. to work on the project. Then work on the project begins and moves to current projects and progress is presented. After work ends, it moves to previous/completed projects. The aim of this application is to support project ideas owners, share work experiences on techncal projects and useful resources, eliminate duplication of ideas, provide opportunities for developers or testers, etc. to work on technical projects.
